# MNIST-Digits-Classification
ðŸ”¢ The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we perform image classification to accurately predict the digit represented in each image, leveraging spatial hierarchies and patterns in the data for effective learning.
